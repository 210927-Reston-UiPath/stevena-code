# Encapsulation in .Net
- Solutions that make up an application
    - group of projects that work together
    - can be heterogeneous
    - you can have a project written in vb, another written in c#
    - usually characterized as your .sln files
        -this .sln file enumerates the projects that are part of the solution
- Projects group together namespaces, classes and other types
- Classes group together data and logic that go together
- Encapsulation is about wrapping data and logic that goes together in one unit
    -This is accomplished by: data wrapping(encaps via packaging) and data hiding(access mods)

## Methods in VB

- 2 types of methods: subs and functions
- Subs return void
